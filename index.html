        <p class="text-area">Each year, millions of people are driven from their homes by floods, storms, droughts, and other weather-related disasters. Unfortunately, these numbers are only likely to increase due to the adverse effects of global climate change including more extreme weather, growing food insecurity, and rising sea levels. Tragically, it is the world’s poorest and most vulnerable communities that are hardest hit. Climate change is already having a significant impact on ecosystems, economies and communities. Rising average temperatures do not simply mean balmier winters. Some regions will experience more extreme heat while others may cool slightly. Flooding, drought and intense summer heat could result. Violent storms and other extreme weather events could also result from the increased energy stored in our warming atmosphere. One of the most serious impacts of climate change is how it will affect water resources around the world. Water is intimately tied to other resource and social issues such as food supply, health, industry, transportation and ecosystem integrity. The impacts of climate change are already being observed across Canada’s diverse geographic regions. Canada’s forests are expected to be among the most vulnerable in the world to climate change. These forests support countless species and ecosystems and are among the many examples of at-risk habitat. The global meltdown of ice sheets and alpine glaciers represents another, taking an immense toll on Arctic ecosystems. Climate change also threatens the health of our children and grandchildren through increased disease, freshwater shortages, worsened smog and more. These impacts also pose incalculable economic risks that far outweigh the economic risks of taking action today. The world’s leading scientists report that to prevent dangerous levels of global warming governments should act to limit global warming to less than 2ºC by taking concerted action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The sooner we act to reduce greenhouse gases, the less severe impacts will be. Now is the time to implement solutions.</p>

                <p class="text-area">We believe that everyone deserves a chance to experience clean enviroment. Environment is a place where humans as well as plants and animals live. Keeping it clean and neat is our responsibility. It is necessary to keep our environment clean because we get fresh air, reduce pollution etc. An unclean environment leads to a bad condition of a society, arrival of diseases and many more.</p>

                <p class="text-area">We believe tha everyone should have an equal right to breathe clean, safe air. Clean air is important to human and animal health because pollutants can cause harm in various ways depending on the pollutant and the timescale of the exposure. Life expectancy and quality can be significantly reduced in places with clean air problems. Pollutants can also have a negative effect on the environment, some accelerating climate change and others leading to the acidification of rain and the erosion of land surfaces and features.</p>

                <p class="text-area">We believe that everyone deserves to drink clean and fresh water. Fresh water is one of our most vital resources, and when our water is polluted it is not only devastating to the environment, but also to human health. Most part of water what we use daily come from rivers, lakes and other surface water sources. Before it is delivered to our homes it is treated to remove chemicals, particulates and bacteria. This clean, potable water is then used for cooking, drinking, cleaning, bathing, watering our lawns and so forth.</p>
